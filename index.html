                    <br>
                    <p> My name is Nick Elwood, and I live and work in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
                    <p> A little about me; Originally from Puerto Rico, I was raised in Jacksonville, Florida, and have lived here for basically all of my life.</p>
                    <p> While I spent my 20's going to college at University of North Florida (where I earned my BA in Psychology), working 3 jobs just to get by, I found my passion and opportunities in Technology.</p>
                    <p> I got my start working as a HelpDesk technician, where I quickly made my way to a level 2 role, which lead to my final hop to System Administrator.</p>
                    <p> I now work as a Systems Administrator - Cloud Systems admin at a small company. While I know I haven't yet hit my peak, I am comfortable where I'm at, and I am working on my personal goals, while also working on my professional accomplishments.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p> I have found many hobbies and passions; Currently, I am working towards completing an IronMan race.</p>
                    <p> If you're not familiar with IronMan, the full race includes a 2.4 mile, open-water swim, followed by a 112 mile bike course, and ending with a full 26.2 mile marathon run. </p>
                    <p> This is going to take <b>a lot</b> of training. I'm ok with that. This year, I've completed 2 half marathons, and expect to complete 2 full marathons (and another half marathon) by March 2024. I am also particpating in RAGBRAI, which is a 500 mile bike ride across Iowa.</p>
                    <p> Ideally, I'll complete the half IronMan in 2025, and the full in 2026, but we'll see how all the prep goes first.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p> Beyond the constant barrage of destroying my body (in a good way), I also enjoy video games, music, learning how to code, and hanging out with my wife and our (way too many) pets.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p> That's enough about me. If you're interested in establishing a professional relationship, you think I'd be cool to work with, or just want to roast me on the internet because my basic site isn't great, hit me up on LinkedIn - just click the LinkedIn icon at the top of this page.</p>
